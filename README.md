## Opinion

Lightweight Kernel + Low level LLM programming is the next step. "LLM OS"

Vector Databases and Memory Management Libraries are exploding in popularity.

Begs the question: "what is after that? step ahead right" 

## Thought

Community is and will collapse on frameworks and libraries as they come out but i think it is fundamentally part of the problem.
We should be looking at fundamentals of computation to decrease the amount of layers and chains for LLMs

## State

Presently we seem to be in the state of 'automation' i call it. Everyone wants to 'automate their life'.
New platforms everyday, all doing the same thing, wrapping LLMs behind massive amount of data to be computed,
using paid APIs to power their platforms and/or charging for copy/paste services(marketing competition).

### Division in the thought process.

Are we building GUIs for LAMs to interact with instead of humans??
that would mean... yes, an insane amount of useless data to be computed for no reasons.
If the goal is to vocally interact with an assitant to have him do as much as possible to accomplish your tasks,
wouldnt it be optimal to compute API and function calls without the need for an extra layer... to be continued
