# Employai OS™ ⭐

## Opinion

Lightweight Kernel + Low level LLM programming is the next step. "LLM OS"

Vector Databases and Memory Management Libraries are exploding in popularity.

Begs the question: "what is after that? step ahead right" 

## Thought

Community is and will collapse on frameworks and libraries as they come out but i think it is fundamentally part of the problem.
We should be looking at fundamentals of computation to decrease the amount of layers and chains for LLMs

## State

Presently we seem to be in the state of 'automation' i call it. Everyone wants to 'automate their life'.
New platforms everyday, all doing the same thing, wrapping LLMs behind massive amount of data to be computed,
using paid APIs to power their platforms and/or charging for copy/paste services(marketing competition).

## Mention

LAM Os (Large Action Model Operating System) by Rabbit and their device(R1)
