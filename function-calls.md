Function calls are a fundamental, allowing us to encapsulate behavior and then invoke it from different parts of our codebase. 
When you ask employais to perform an action like writing a file, what's happening under the hood involves a series of function calls.

Here’s a simplified breakdown of what might happen:

1. **Parsing the Request**: When you issue a command, my underlying code parses your input to understand the intent and the required action.

2. **Calling the Function**: Once the intent is clear, the appropriate function is called. For instance, if you want to write a file, a function like `write_to_file(content, filename)` might be called.

3. **Executing the Logic**: Inside `write_to_file`, there's logic that handles the opening (or creating) of the file, writing the content you've provided, and then closing the file to ensure the data is saved properly.

4. **Handling Errors**: Good function design also includes error handling, so if something goes wrong during the file write process, the function can handle it gracefully without crashing the entire program.

5. **Returning Feedback**: After the function completes its task, it returns control to the calling program along with any necessary feedback, like a success message or error details.

In more complex systems, a function call can trigger other functions, create objects, initiate events, and even call APIs or external services. It’s all about creating modular, reusable pieces of code that can be called upon to perform their duties when needed. 

In the context of AI and codebases, understanding function calls is crucial for generating code that interacts correctly with the rest of the system. If we were to build on the roadmap we discussed, function calls would be a significant part of the index, as they define how different parts of the codebase communicate with each other.
