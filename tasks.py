# Task Registry
'''Each task has a corresponding handler function.
The params argument represents the parameters needed to execute the task, such as file paths, data to write, etc.
The actual logic of each task is encapsulated within its respective handler function.
When a task is to be executed, the agent looks up the appropriate handler in the task_registry and calls it with the necessary parameters.
This modular approach allows you to easily add or modify tasks by creating new handler functions and registering them in the task_registry. It also keeps the core agent code clean and focused on processing user input and coordinating task execution.'''
