# Employai Roadmap

## Phase 1: Planning and Design
- **Define the Scope**: List all the tasks you want Employai to perform.
- **User Flow Diagram**: Sketch a diagram of the typical user interactions with the app.
- **Design GUI Mockups**: Create mockups for the GUI using a tool like Figma or Sketch.

## Phase 2: Environment Setup
- **Development Environment**: Set up your local development environment with Flask.
- **Version Control**: Initialize a Git repository to manage your codebase.

## Phase 3: Core Flask Application
- **Flask Skeleton**: Create a basic Flask app structure with routes and templates.
- **HTML Templates**: Develop the HTML pages based on your GUI design.
- **CSS Styling**: Style the HTML templates with CSS to match your mockups.

## Phase 4: JavaScript and AJAX
- **JavaScript Functions**: Write JavaScript functions for handling user inputs and displaying outputs.
- **AJAX Setup**: Implement AJAX calls to send data to and receive data from the Flask backend without reloading the page.

## Phase 5: Backend Development
- **OpenAI Integration**: Set up integration with OpenAI's API for processing natural language.
- **Command Parsing**: Develop the logic to parse predefined commands and user inputs.
- **Task Execution**: Implement the core functions that the app will perform based on user commands.

## Phase 6: Testing and Iteration
- **Local Testing**: Test the application's functionality on your local machine.
- **Iterative Improvements**: Refine the user interface and backend logic based on testing feedback.

## Phase 7: Packaging and Distribution
- **Package Application**: Package your Flask app into an executable for Windows using tools like PyInstaller.
- **Documentation**: Write basic documentation on how to install and run the application.

## Phase 8: Post-Development
- **Open Source Preparations**: If considering open sourcing, prepare the codebase with proper documentation and comments.
- **Initial Release**: Release the first version of the app, even if just for personal use, to establish a baseline.

## Phase 9: Future Considerations (Post-Roadmap)
- **Feedback Loop**: Once the app is in use, create a system to collect feedback for future improvements.
- **Updates and Maintenance**: Plan for ongoing maintenance and updates based on your usage.
